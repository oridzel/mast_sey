These examples showcase most of the capabilities of the code.
They serve as a tutorial for thr code and also allow to reproduce the results presented in the paper which this code accompanies:
Maciej P. Polak and Dane Morgan, *MAST-SEY: MAterial Simulation Toolkit for Secondary Electron Yield. A Monte Carlo Approach to Secondary Electron Emission Based On Complex Dielectric Functions*, Comp. Mat. Sci. XXX, xx, (2021) (https://doi.org/10.1016/xx.xx.xx)

Two material systems are considered: copper and aluminium.

Each directory contains all the neccessary input files and a set of commands that should be executed. It also contains a directory with the calculations already completed, for comparison.

It is highly recommended to execute the code on multiple cores for efficiency. For that users might find particularily helpful the [GNU Parralel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) software.
